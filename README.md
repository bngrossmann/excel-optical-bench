Simulation of a lens on an optical bench made in Excel.

This is one of a few simulations originally created in the Spring of 2020 while I was working as a physics instructor. The sudden switch to remote learning during the rapid spread of COVID-19 required changes in teaching physics labs. Without access to physical equipment, I considered rewriting labs to use items typically found at home. However, the topics for the rest of the semester included magnetism, light, and circuits; and it would be unlikely any of my students would have the necessary items to investigate those topics. So, I decided simulations could be the next best thing.

Many of the good simulations I knew about were no longer available because Flash was gone (R.I.P.). Other simulations I found were inadequate for my needs. There wasn't time to aquire a sufficient proficiency with HTML5 and Javascript to build new ones. In my search for something, anything, I came across http://www.engineers-excel.com/. Using this as an inspiration, I proceeded to build some simulations a software environment my students were familiar with.
